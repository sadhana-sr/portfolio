            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                When physical or occupational therapy patients leave the hospital, they don‚Äôt always know what exercises to do or when and how to do them. Patients need guidance in ensuring they are following proper form and schedule, especially being away from constant surveillance of a PT/OT.<br>
                Currently, patients have the option of visiting their PT/OT in person during appointments, but this may not always be accessible due to physical convenience or financial constraints. There are also existing videos online that help with various exercises, but without the ability to offer and receive feedback in live time, both doctors and patients have no way of knowing if such exercises are being performed correctly, which risks causing more harm than help.

                    Our team conducted interviews to get a sense of the problems current and former physical therapy patients experienced in terms of completing at-home exercises. Upon analyzing these interviews, there was a pattern of three main pain points:

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
                After performing a usability inspection on the paper prototype, the team created low-fidelity wireframes. I focused on wire-framing the AR/VR feature, and the Ratings page.
            </p>
            <div class="paper-row" style="padding-top:5%">

            <p>
                Our wireframes were then translated into the first version of an interactive high-fidelity prototype. This prototype went through a few rounds of usability testing, where our team logged the usability defects and made iterative improvements. Below is an example of a usability log for P1.

            <h2>Visual Design</h2>
            <p>We created a design system to maintain consistency through the app. The color scheme, typography, and use of emojis makes doing physical therapy exercises more exciting, and the app feels a little more personal than typical in the PT space. </p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2><br>
            <p><mark class ="hilight">We are designing for the user - not for the team.üë§</mark>
            <br>Going into initial ideation of this project, I had several assumptions about the needs and wants of physical therapy patients - most of which were disproven through interviews! For example, a feature we thought would be of great need was a community aspect to patient care. However, every single interview participant expressed a strong aversion, and actually did not want much interaction with anyone other than their PT. We might have thought this because of a lack of social interaction due to the global pandemic. Or maybe, it was because we overestimated the role that physical therapy plays in a patient's everyday. Either way, it is important that we do not impose biases or let them reflect in the design. User interviews and user personas played a sizable role in keeping our biases out of the process.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><mark class ="hilight">Accessibility is very important! ‚ôø
            </mark>
            <br>The first round of usability testing revealed a large issue in the UI. Many older participants reported being unable to read the text, or interpret symbols, due to color contrast or the size of the text. The majority of physical therapy patients fall into the 65+ age category. On top of that, given that the application's main selling point is AR/VR, usability for senior citizens should be heavily emphasized so that they can feel comfortable adopting this new-age technology into their routines. Once realized, I was able to make several changes to both text and color that eased a lot of of the slip-ups that users were experiencing.</p>
